# Key.io

## Getting Started
- Clone down the project from Github
- Run `npm i` in the terminal to install the npm packages
- To start the client, run `npm start` in the terminal
- To start the server, run `nodemon` in another instance of the terminal
- Both commands will make live updates as you code, so you won't have to stop and restart each process as you make changes.
- To cancel out of these processes, press the contol key and the letter `c` at the same time in each terminal.
### Branches, merges, PR's
- When starting to develop, create a separate branch to work on by running the command `git checkout -b <branch name>`
- When you are ready to merge your changes to the master branch, create a Pull Request and send it to the other person working on the project to approve the PR.
- Once PR is approved, checkout to the master branch and `git pull` to get the updated code.
- Avoid working and making changes in the same files to avoid merge conflicts
